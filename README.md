This program looks at a math problem I thought of regarding a beam of light emitted from the top of a 10-foot pole. Since the ray of light forms the hypotenuse of a right triangle with surfaces, at what distances does the ray strike a surface as it approaches 90 degrees. In particular, at what distance does it strike just before it is at 90 degrees and perpendicular to the surface? I had to experiment with GridBag layout to display panel components proportionately upon resizing of window. It uses Math.toRadians, Math.PI, and Math.tan functions to compute the various distances. It also uses ImageIcon to display images (baseball infield, Aususta 16th hole, Indy race track, etc.) reflecting distances for various angles (75.0, 85.0, 89.0, 89.9, 89.9999. etc.)
